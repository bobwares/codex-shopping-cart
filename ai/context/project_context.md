# Project Context

## Project 

- Name: Shopping Cart

- Application Implementation Pattern:  full-stack-app-nextjs-nestjs
 
- Description 


  The Shopping Cart project delivers a standardized service for managing online purchase sessions within an e-commerce system. It handles the full lifecycle of a cartâ€”from creating and persisting a cart instance, to adding, updating, and removing items, and finally checking out. The system enforces validation rules for product availability, pricing, and quantity, while maintaining consistency with inventory and customer profiles. It persists cart state in a relational database and exposes well-defined CRUD APIs for frontend clients and downstream integrations. Designed with extensibility in mind, it integrates seamlessly with order management, payment processing, and recommendation services, forming a core building block in the commerce transaction pipeline.
